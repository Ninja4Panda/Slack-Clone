# Iteration Three

Due to our success of our project with iteration 2, we decided to employ the same techniques we used in the last iteration. Thus, you may see similar content from the previous teamwork.md.

### Meetings
We had face-to-face meetings in the labs on Mondays as well as every Friday from 3. We had a voice call on Sunday (17th November) and constant communication in the messenger group chat for any discussions. Meeting every few days meant that we felt motivated to do consistent work, and not leave things to the last minute. It also ensured that everyone was up-to-date on the team’s progress.

To ensure that our meetings were successful, we:
- **Kept minutes**: Sometimes a team member would be absent so we would take minutes so that they could be informed of what they missed. These minutes are uploaded to our google drive.
- **Set goals**: This helped us get focused on what was important and what we needed to prioritise. The meeting could therefore have a clear aim, so we didn't get sidetracked and were able to accomplish something each time.
- **Started with a summary of what we have done and what problems we faced and then went through it in detail**: This made sure we were aware of the problems present and what had been attempted, so we could give our own advice on how to proceed.
- **Ended with a summary of what we have achieved and what we need to do next**: It motivated us when we saw what we had achieved and made sure we were on the right track.
- **Kept in constant communication on messenger**: Meetings weren’t the only place we talked. We constantly communicated on messenger to make sure everyone was updated on the progress of the backend as well as any problems that had appeared.


### Steps we took when things did not go to plan during iteration 3
When things went wrong or there were major decisions to make, we talked about it with each other. Bugs and issues were put on the board in GitLab and mentioned in the group chat so that everyone was aware and could give input. 

### How we ensured our success
We had regular meetings and set deadlines for different parts to be completed to make sure that all the work was completed on time, as well as leaving some time to test using the front end and work on code style.

### How we had multiple people working on the same code
After iteration 2, we met up to discuss the allocation of spec changes and to distribute iteration 3 tasks. We kept in constant communication online as we worked so that any issues that might affect the whole team were made known. During face-to-face-meetings, we employed pair/tri/quad programming, which we found worked well as each team member could give input and any mistakes were quickly picked up. This was especially useful when refactoring the system, as it meant that the whole group was aware of the exact implementation.
We also completed the documentation collectively and submitted it using one member's account.
