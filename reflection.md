# Team Meetings and Communication
Apart from during weekly labs where we shortly discussed issues we may have had with our pytests, we had the following face-to-face and online meetings:
### Team meeting: Friday 27/09/2019 (2 hours)
- Assigned tests and set a hard deadline for tests to be completed (Wednesday 02/10/2019)
- Brainstormed user stories

### Voice Call: Wednesday 02/10/2019 (3 hours)
- Completed assumptions.md and plan.md

### Team meeting: Friday 04/10/2019 (2 hours)
- Merged pytests and resolved some conflicts
- Wrote most of reflection.md
- Discussed issues with the merge and assigned tasks to complete

### Voice Call: Saturday 05/10/2019 (3 hours)
- Edited pytests
- Finalised all the documents

In addition, throughout the whole three weeks we continuously discussed other goals, deadlines and any issues we faced on messenger and discord. 

# Examples of how we operated as a well-functioning team
As shown above, we communicate with each other often and hold regular meetings both in-person and online. These meetings were often successful and resulted in increased productivity towards the project as well as fixing any problems or concerns that were raised.

In addition, we also participated in pair-programming, where one person coded and the others would suggest what to code. This often resulted in an increase in understanding of the code being used especially while writing the tests. 

One reason for us trying out pair programming was because of the issues we faced with git merge conflicts, which we found to be confusing and bothersome due to our lack of experience. In order to avoid these merge conflicts, we had to try and avoid editing the same file at the same time, and pushing/pulling regularly. This was a challenge that we overcame through regular communication in the group, where we would let others know in the group of when we should “pull” and when it is safe to edit the code to avoid merge conflicts.


# Responsibility Allocation
We used Trello to distribute tasks. The function tests were distributed evenly with each team member being allocated eight interface functions to test. The documentation was done as a group using Google Docs.

# Areas for Improvement
One area in which we could improve as a group is discussing helper functions before implementing them. We should also try to keep a more consistent code style.
In addition, it would be good for each of us to learn more about github and how to avoid merge conflicts.
